# EnrollmentTotals

A script that runs twice per day that collects enrollment information for various courses at University of waterloo and stores it in a database.

At the end of the school term, I will compile the information from the database to create graphs of how the enrollment totals changed over time in hopes of finding interesting trends of course unenrollment.
